# Angular-chart.js Demo

##Intro

This is a demo of angular-chart.js. It is part of a live presentation that demos angular-chart.

[The corresponding slides are here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NGVv01jGE6hrTyRgwuQpQjvfZPCwlqYavznfMKgGODQ/edit?usp=sharing)

There are commits in the top right corner of the slides. If you get lost, use "git checkout ####" to have everything up to that point.

The first part of the demo is about angular.js. It is a very short and very basic demo to show you how to use angular. The second part is about angular-chart.js, where different functionalities are shown.

If there is time, there will be a third part regarding the reactive components of angular-chart.
